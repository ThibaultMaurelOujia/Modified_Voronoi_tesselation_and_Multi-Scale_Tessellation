The original version of the C++ code has been developed by Thibault Maurel Oujia at I2M, Aix-Marseille University to compute the volume cell in parallel using OpenMP for shared memory and compute the divergence and curl of the particle velocity.
During the JSPS Short-term 2023 Thibault Maurel Oujia implemented parallel computation of the volume using MPI for distributed memory and wavelets on graphs using MPI for distributed memory.
